### Project:  
	- Predict which coils will have a constriction based on its metrics measured before being processed. 

### Steps:  
	1. Filter which coils have constriction based on absolute difference between the interval of 140 - 170 meters on the coils b4 and b5.  
	2. Label every coil if it has a constriction or not.  
	3. Setup pipeline for ML classifier model.  
	4. Evaluation of classifiers.  
	5. Retrain all the classifiers with the most important metrics.
